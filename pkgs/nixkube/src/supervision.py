"""Crash-loop supervision for long-running coroutines.

Wraps coroutine factories with restart logic and crash-loop detection.
A crash loop is defined as max_restarts failures within a sliding time window.
When detected, CrashLoopError is raised, which propagates through asyncio.gather()
to cancel siblings and exit the process (Kubernetes restarts the pod with backoff).
